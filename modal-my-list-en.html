<p>All records you marked as favorite during sessions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can save your favorite records into the custom lists and notes can be attached to them (use the <strong>"Edit"</strong> button). You can delete them from the list in bulk or one by one.</p>

<p>The items you marked as favorite as an unlogged user, are saved in the <strong>"Transferred favorites"</strong> list. You can also rename your lists and describe them using the <strong>"Edit list"</strong> button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other features:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Email:</strong> If only one item was selected, the recipient receives a link to the full record. If more than one item is selected, a link to the whole list is sent - the recipient will not see the list name, or any of your other user data.</li>
	<li><strong>Export:</strong> Download bibliographic citations of selected items as a plain text file or export them to one of the listed reference managers.</li>
	<li><strong>Print</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
