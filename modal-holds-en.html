<p>Your current orders and reservations in connected libraries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The option to cancel your orders and reservations could be time limited</strong> depending on system settings of your library. Orders could be usually canceled just shortly after ordering, if even possible to do so, if at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the publication you request has been borrowed by other user, you can make a reservation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ordering is usually used for publications stored in a library closed stack, or for putting on hold in branch library.</p>
