<p><strong>Link your&nbsp;identities from connected&nbsp;libraries and social networks.</strong></p>

<p>Click on&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Connect another identity&quot;</strong> button and continue by logging in with an identity of any institution&nbsp;listed in&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Connect with library identity&quot;</strong> or social network identity from&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Alternative login&quot;</strong> list (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub<!--, mojeID-->, ORCID).</p>

<p>Once you attach other connected library&#39;s identity to your account(*), you&nbsp;<strong>gain access an overview of your activities in this library, and you will be able to order or reserve publications.</strong></p>

<p>In case&nbsp;<strong>you are not registered in any of the connected libraries</strong>&nbsp;and logged in just&nbsp;<strong>using&nbsp;a social network identity or <!--mojeID or -->ORCID</strong>, you will not be able to order or reserve a publication in connected libraries, though&nbsp;<strong>you can still save your favorite searches and records</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Learn more about registration in participating libraries&nbsp;<a href="../../../Portal/Page/moznosti-prihlaseni-a-registrace" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>You can use any of your connected identities to access your account. You can simply&nbsp;<strong>disconnect</strong> your linked identities anytime. It is also possible to&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Delete portal account&quot;&nbsp;</strong>- this action removes all your user settings, saved searches and favorites lists. Disconnecting an identity or deleting a portal account affects only portal Knihovny.cz - it will not cancel your registration in any library.</p>

<p><strong>Linking more than one identity within one library is not possible. It is also not possible to link one identity from library A with more than one identity from library</strong><strong>&nbsp;B</strong> (as library cards are not transferable).</p>

<h6>(*)The account in Knihovny.cz ties your linked library and social network identities. When you sing in for the first time, your portal account includes just one identity - that one you used for your first logging in. The decision to connect more identities is up to you.</h6>
