<h2><strong>1 Signing-in and overview of services according to user permission</strong><a id="1" name="1">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<h3><a id="1.1" name="1.1">1.1 Signing-in</a></h3>
<p>You can log in with an account of any institution listed in&nbsp;<strong>"Connect with library's account"</strong> or social network account from&nbsp;<strong>"Alternative login"</strong> list (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub,
    <!-- mojeID,-->ORCID).</p>
<p>Once you sign in with an account of any participating library, you&nbsp;<strong>gain access an overview of your activities in this library, and you will be able to order or reserve publications</strong>.</p>
<p>When logging in with a particular library account for the first time, the message about transmitted service may appear (the reappearance of this message at next logon depends on how you set the validity of consent). Then you will see a request for consent to storing data in accordance with Act no. 101/2000 Coll. on personal data protection. You will not log in without acknowledgment and agreement to these two questions.</p>
<p>In case you are <strong>not registered in any of the connected libraries</strong> and logged in through a <strong>social network account<!--, mojeID--> or ORCID</strong>, you will not be able to order or reserve a publication in connected libraries but <strong>you can still save your favorite records and searches</strong>.</p>
<p>Learn more about registration in participating libraries <a href="../../../Portal/Page/moznosti-prihlaseni-a-registrace" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can <strong>link your library and social network accounts</strong> in Knihovny.cz (<a href="#5.7">read more</a>) - you can use any of them to log in.</p>

<h2><strong>2 Search</strong><a id="2" name="2">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p><strong>The search box</strong>, working similarly to Google search, <strong>is used for simple search</strong>.</p>
<p>If the search box is empty, by clicking on <strong>"Find"</strong> button, the list of all entries within the portal will be shown</p>
<p><strong>The search results can be listed in accordance with a relevance, the newest first, the oldest first, or in alphabetical order according to an author or a title.</strong></p>

<p>International resources are indexed by the third side - that is why some operators are different.</p>
<h3><a id="2.2" name="2.2">2.2 Prompt</a></h3>
<p>To make search easier, a <strong>prompt</strong> is available in the search box for simple search. <strong>This offers the most relevant phrases for the term entered</strong> within three categories: <strong>titles, authors and topics</strong>. User can pick a phrase suggested by the prompt or search the term without use of any prompt.</p>
<p>It is necessary to note that as the portal includes records from many libraries, the same topic can be often found in the prompt more than once. For example, name Karel IV. can be suggested in a number of versions while each of these contain different records.</p>
<h3><a id="2.3" name="2.3">2.3 Advanced search</a></h3>
<p>A form for advanced search allows users to enter a complex and complicated queries.</p>
<p>For each word&nbsp;<strong>it is possible to specify the category of search</strong>. There are following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In All Fields</li>
    <li>Title, series</li>
    <li>Author, corporation and action</li>
    <li>Subject, key word</li>
    <li>Published in - <em>for articles</em></li>
    <li>ISBN/ISSN/ISMN</li>

    <li>Fulltexts and contents - <em>of indexed sources</em></li>
    <li>International patent classification - <em>searching by IPC class</em></li>    
</ul>
<h4>2.3.1 Search box<a id="2.3.1" name="2.3.1">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>User chooses the category which will be searched from the drop-down list (with pre-set search <strong>&quot;In All Fields&quot;</strong>).<br /> It is&nbsp;<strong>possible to add additional search boxes</strong>&nbsp;and enter into them additional search terms.<br /> Logical operators from a short drop-down menu can be applied on any search box in the group. There are following options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>All terms</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator AND</li>
    <li><strong>Any term</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator OR</li>
    <li><strong>No term</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator NOT</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.3.2 Search group<a id="2.3.2" name="2.3.2">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p><strong>Adding a search group allows the user to add additional search boxes, on which another logical operator can be applied.</strong>&nbsp;Therefore, for example records in which occur all terms from the first group while only selected terms from another group can be searched.<br />
    <strong>Logical operator can be applied also on search groups.</strong>&nbsp;There are following options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>All groups</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator AND</li>
    <li><strong>Any groups</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator OR</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply the changes in the form it is necessary to&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Update results&quot;</strong>.<br /> To clear the form, click on the&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Clear&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Příklad:</strong>&nbsp;Search the publications about Daniel Defoe not written by Daniel Defoe.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Type &ldquo;Daniel Defoe&rdquo; to the search box with preset searching <strong>&ldquo;In all fields&rdquo;</strong></li>
    <li>Use <strong>&ldquo;Add search box&rdquo;</strong> button under the search form</li>
    <li>In the dropdown menu of the new group choose <strong>&ldquo;No term&rdquo;</strong></li>
    <li>Choose the search option <strong>&ldquo;Author&rdquo;</strong> for the new searchbox and type &ldquo;Daniel Defoe&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Click on the <strong>&ldquo;Update results&rdquo;</strong> button to apply your search query</li>
</ol>

<p>In each search box you can use <strong>the same operators and wildcards as in simple search</strong> (<a href="#2.1">read more</a>).</p>
<h3><a id="2.4" name="2.4">2.4 "Domestic resources" and "International resources"</a></h3>
<p>Portal Knihovny.cz allows users to perform search in two separated indexes: "Domestic resources" and "International resources".</p>
<p><strong>To switch between "Domestic resources" and "International resources" use the tabs displayed above side panel with filters</strong> ("Narrow search")<strong> in the search results list.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It is possible to switch among records of different libraries by drop-down list&nbsp;"Select instituion".</strong>&nbsp;To see opening hours, contact or address, click on&nbsp;<strong>"Information about library"</strong>.</p>
<p>If the user is signed-in with an account connected to one or more libraries where they are registered, first records shown would be from those libraries.</p>
<p><strong>This icon</strong>&nbsp;<strong><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanaKurfurstova/varcpkfiles/master/iconUser.png" alt="ikona hlavy" width="20" height="20" /></strong>&nbsp;is visible next to the name and year of birth/death of&nbsp;<strong>some authors</strong>.

<p>Column&nbsp;<strong>"Similar"</strong>&nbsp;displays publications with similar record to the current one. It is possible that here the same publication appears in case this record have not merged with others. As records of libraries are very diverse, it is problematic to eliminate all of these.

<h3><a id="4.2" name="4.2">4.2 Tab "Borrow"</a></h3>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>list of units of a particular publication</strong>, which is available in library. It is possible to switch among libraries in the drop-down list&nbsp;<strong>"Select institution"</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Your Account</strong><a id="5" name="5">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>User gains access to various features by signing in to portal Knihovny.cz. The list of these is available in <a href="#1.2">the first chapter of this manual</a>.</p>
<p>It is necessary to have already existent account for signing in to Knihovny.cz. It is possible to sign in with any institution listed in&nbsp;<strong>"Connect with library's account"</strong> or social network account from&nbsp;<strong>"Alternative login"</strong> list (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, <!--mojeID, -->ORCID).</p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages for signed-in users is the possibility to&nbsp;<strong>link accounts</strong>&nbsp;(explained in detail in chapter&nbsp; <a href="#5.7">Linked accounts</a>).</p>
<p>The portal itself does not allow to create a new account. However, it is possible to register online, to pre-register or to register remotely in some of participating libraries. The list of libraries is available&nbsp;<a href="../../../Portal/Page/moznosti-prihlaseni-a-registrace">here</a>. Pre-registration differs from registration by the requirement to visit a library in person to finish the registration (usually to pay the registration fee). Remote registration consists of more steps than online registration (according to library's instructions).</p>
<p>Information described in the following chapters are available after signing in. It can be found in the menu after clicking on the user name in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
<h3><a id="5.1" name="5.1">5.1 Checked Out Items</a></h3>

<p>Ordering is usually used for publications stored in a library closed stack, or for putting on hold in branch library.</p>
<p>Conditions for borrowing, ordering and reservations are different for each library - some of the connected libraries provide a custom help visible after clicking on the grey question mark in the request form screen.</p>
