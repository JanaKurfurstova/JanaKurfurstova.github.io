<h2><strong>2 Domestic resources</strong><a id="2" name="2">&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>Collections of Czech libraries, domestic databases and bibliographies. They also include documents in other languages if they are available in Czech libraries.</p>

<p>Most of the documents can be physically borrowed.</p>

<h3><a id="2.1" name="2.1">2.1 Search in Domestic resources</a></h3>

<p><strong>The search box</strong>, working similarly to Google search, <strong>is used for simple search</strong>.</p>

<p>If the search box is empty, by clicking on <strong>"Find"</strong> button, the list of all entries within the Domestic resources will be shown</p>

<p><strong>The search results can be listed in accordance with a relevance, the newest first, the oldest first, or in alphabetical order according to an author or a title.</strong></p>

<h4><strong><a id="2.1.1" name="2.1.1">2.1.1 Search operators and wildcards in Domestic resources</a></strong></h4>

<p>You can use Boolean operators and wildcards in <strong>simple and advanced search</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>Edgar Allan Poe</code></strong><br />
	multi-word term search <strong>results prioritize</strong> search term <strong>equivalence to author names</strong> (in order <code>name surname</code>) <strong>and main publication titles</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>&quot;Poe&#39;s Raven&quot;</code></strong><br />
	search <strong>phrase between quotation marks, i. e.</strong><strong> </strong><strong><code>Poe&#39;s Raven</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>Poe AND Raven</code></strong><br />
	search terms containing<strong> <code>Poe</code> as well as <code>Raven</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>Poe OR Raven</code></strong><br />
	search terms containing <strong>at least one of the words</strong><strong> </strong><code>Poe</code><strong> or </strong><code>Raven</code></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>Poe NOT Raven</code></strong> or <strong><code>Poe -Raven</code></strong><br />
	search terms <strong>containing <code>Poe</code> and not containing <code>Raven</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>poe AND (raven OR (life AND work))</code></strong><br />
	you can use <strong>parentheses</strong> (even nested) to make advanced queries<br />
	searching is <strong>not case sensitive</strong> and <strong>ignores punctation and diacritics</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>+Poe Raven</code></strong><br />
	search terms <strong>necessarily containing</strong><strong> <code>Poe</code></strong> and <strong>possibly containing</strong><strong> <code>Raven</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>R*ven</code></strong><br />
	search terms <strong>with empty or random string of characters in place of <code>*</code></strong> (you cannot use that in the beginning of the term)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>R?ven</code></strong><br />
	search terms begining with <code>R</code> and ending with <code>ven</code> <strong>with one character in place of <code>?</code></strong> (you cannot use that in the beginning of the term)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><code><strong>Raven~</strong></code><strong> /</strong><code><strong> Raven~0.8</strong></code><br />
	search terms <strong>similar to</strong><strong> </strong><code>Raven</code><strong> (Haven, Ravel)</strong>; degree of similarity is defined by setting value from 0 to 1 (default is 0.5)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><code><strong>&quot;Poe Raven&quot;~3</strong></code><br />
	<strong>proximity search</strong>; search terms with <strong>at most three words between</strong> <code>Poe</code><strong> and </strong><code>Raven</code> (regardless of the order)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><code><strong>Poe Raven^8 poetry^6</strong></code><br />
	<strong>preferential search</strong> where<strong> the word significanceis given by the value after <code>^</code></strong> (a term without <code>^</code> has the lowest value)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>{Po TO Pr}</code> / <code>[2001 TO 2003]</code></strong><br />
	<strong>range search</strong> (terms begining with Po, Pp, Pq and Pr / numbers from 2001 to 2003)</li>
</ul> 

<h4><strong><a id="2.1.2" name="2.1.2">2.1.2 Prompt</a></strong></h4>

<p>To make search easier, a <strong>prompt</strong> is available in the search box for simple search. <strong>This offers the most relevant phrases for the term entered</strong> within three categories: <strong>titles, authors and topics</strong>. User can pick a phrase suggested by the prompt or search the term without use of any prompt.</p>

<p>It is necessary to note that as the portal includes records from many libraries, the same topic can be often found in the prompt more than once. For example, name Karel IV. can be suggested in a number of versions while each of these contain different records.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="2.1.3" name="2.1.3">2.1.3 Advanced search in Domestic resources</a></strong></h4>

<p>A form for advanced search allows users to enter a complex and complicated queries.</p>

<p>Terms entered to the form for advanced search can contain <strong>the same <a href="#2.1.1">operators and wildcards</a> as in simple search</strong>.</p>

<p>For each word&nbsp;<strong>it is possible to specify the category of search</strong>. There are following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>In All Fields</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title, series</strong></li>
<li><strong>Author, corporation and action</strong></li>
<li><strong>Subject, key word</strong></li>
<li><strong>Published in</strong> - <em>for articles</em></li>
<li><strong>ISBN/ISSN/ISMN</strong></li>
<li><strong>Call number</strong> - <em>signature</em></li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong></li>
<li><strong>Year of Publication</strong></li>

<li><strong>Fulltexts and contents</strong> - <em>of indexed sources</em></li>
<li><strong>International patent classification</strong> - <em>searching by IPC class</em></li>    
</ul>

<h5><strong>2.1.3.1 Search box<a id="2.1.3.1" name="2.1.3.1">&nbsp;</a></strong></h5>

<p>User chooses the category which will be searched from the drop-down list (with pre-set search <strong>&quot;In All Fields&quot;</strong>).<br /> It is&nbsp;<strong>possible to add additional search boxes</strong>&nbsp;and enter into them additional search terms.<br /> Logical operators from a short drop-down menu can be applied on any search box in the group. There are following options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>All terms</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator AND</li>
    <li><strong>Any term</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator OR</li>
    <li><strong>No term</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator NOT</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>2.1.3.2 Search group<a id="2.1.3.2" name="2.1.3.2">&nbsp;</a></strong></h5>

<p><strong>Adding a search group allows the user to add additional search boxes, on which another logical operator can be applied.</strong>&nbsp;Therefore, for example records in which occur all terms from the first group while only selected terms from another group can be searched.<br />
    <strong>Logical operator can be applied also on search groups.</strong>&nbsp;There are following options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>All groups</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator AND</li>
    <li><strong>Any groups</strong>&nbsp;- i.e. logical operator OR</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply the changes in the form it is necessary to&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Update results&quot;</strong>.<br /> To clear the form, click on the&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Clear&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>The Czech Republic has the densest network of public libraries in whole European Union.</p>

<p>This section offers a &nbsp;<strong>contact information including opening hours</strong>&nbsp;of all libraries, which are listed in the directory of National Library of the Czech Republic. As the directory data are retrieved from National Library's Central Directory of libraries, it is possible that for some libraries, the branch libraries are listed separately (for these have separate SIGLA). Data changed in CADR will not appear in the directory immediately, but after a few hours.</p>

<p>Majority of these libraries do not participate in portal Knihovny.cz. Nonetheless,&nbsp;<strong>the number of participating libraries will gradually increase</strong>.</p>

<p>To find the library it is possible enter a query to the search box (name, city/town, or SIGLA can be entered), or to find it on the map.</p>

<h2><strong>5 Your Account</strong><a id="5" name="5">&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>User gains access to various features by signing in to portal Knihovny.cz. The list of these is available in <a href="#1.2">the first chapter of this manual</a>.</p>

<p>It is necessary to have already existent account for signing in to Knihovny.cz. It is possible to sign in with any institution listed in&nbsp;<strong>"Connect with library's account"</strong> or social network account from&nbsp;<strong>"Alternative login"</strong> list (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, <!--mojeID, -->ORCID).</p>

<p>One of the most significant advantages for signed-in users is the possibility to&nbsp;<strong>link accounts</strong>&nbsp;(explained in detail in chapter&nbsp; <a href="#5.7">Linked accounts</a>).</p>

<p>The portal itself does not allow to create a new account. However, it is possible to register online, to pre-register or to register remotely in some of participating libraries. The list of libraries is available&nbsp;<a href="../../../Portal/Page/moznosti-prihlaseni-a-registrace">here</a>. Pre-registration differs from registration by the requirement to visit a library in person to finish the registration (usually to pay the registration fee). Remote registration consists of more steps than online registration (according to library's instructions).</p>

<p>Information described in the following chapters are available after signing in. It can be found in the menu after clicking on the user name in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>

<h3><a id="5.1" name="5.1">5.1 Checked Out Items</a></h3>

<p>Your current loans in connected libraries.</p>

<p>You can try to postpone your due date if&nbsp;<strong>"Renew"</strong>&nbsp;button is visible.</p>

<p>Renewing the loan is probably not possible in following cases:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Some other user has the book reserved.</li>
    <li>You have already renewed your loan before and reached the limit for renewing particular book.</li>
    <li>Your library card / registration expires soon.</li>
    <li>You have some fine or charge to pay.</li>
</ol>

<p>This overview is visible only to users with linked account of at least one of the connected libraries (<a href="#5.7">read more</a>).</p>

<h3><a id="5.2" name="5.2">5.2 Checked out history</a></h3>

<p>This section shows a list of publications, which have been borrowed by user. Not all of participating libraries may support this feature on Knihovny.cz</p>
