<p>All records you marked as favorite during sessions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You favorite records can be sorted into the custom lists and notes can be attached to them (use the <strong>&ldquo;Edit&rdquo;</strong> button).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The items you marked as favorite as an unlogged user, are saved in the <strong>&ldquo;Transferred favorites&rdquo;</strong> list. You can also rename your lists and describe them using the <strong>&ldquo;Edit list&rdquo;</strong> button.&nbsp;</p>
