<p>Portal Knihovny.cz provides the unified access to services offered by Czech libraries - for everyone, from everywhere and anytime. This portal allows you to <strong>search catalogs of all participating libraries using</strong> a single search bar.</p>

<p>The densest public libraries infrastructure in the European Union is the pride of the Czech Republic, and Knihovny.cz has the ambition to become the gateway to the most of them (you can see the list of already participating libraries <a href="zapojene-knihovny-a-zdroje">here</a>).</p>

<p>In future, besides connecting even more libraries than now, <strong>we are planning to extend our portal by central index</strong> which will help you to search a varied range of quality worldwide expert resources. Portal Knihovny.cz could become <strong>your everyday tool for finding reliable information</strong>and a go-between for obtaining it. Did not find what you were looking for in your library? Do you need to draw on trusted resources? Or are you just looking for a reader's inspiration? Then Knihovny.cz is just for you.</p>

<h2><a id="Security" name="Security"><strong>Security Policy</strong></a></h2>

<p>In the development of this portal, a great emphasis was put on the data security. This portal does not collect any information about users, their borrowings or their financial transactions. For signing in, it verifies the identity of the user through the library which is used for logging in. For secure sign-in etc. the security of websites and sing-in on the side of connected libraries is crucial. Communication between the user and portal launched by signing-in is set on the secure protocol https, and therefore it is protected from being abused.</p>
