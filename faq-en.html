<h4>1. I cannot find a library in the list of libraries.&nbsp;Is it really there?</h4>

<p>Please, try to change your query. Names of some libraries does not hav to match thoroughly with the requested name (they can be named for example just &quot;Public library&quot;).</p>

<p>If you cannot find the library under its presumed name, please <strong>try to enter to the search box a name of a city or a town</strong>, where the library is located.</p>

<h4>2. Results are not sorted as I expected. I am searching for example for a book by entering its title but I cannot see it within a first few search results. How is it possible?</h4>

<p>Settings of the results&rsquo; sorting is an issue we are exhaustively working on to resolve. This is an extensively complicated matter, which needs to be dealt with by an agreement among participating libraries, as these are significantly different from each other. Currently the majority of participating institutions are big research libraries with considerably dissimilar requirements to public and city libraries regarding the sorting of search results. Research libraries put an emphasis on searching the scholarly articles. We already have a few participating city libraries, which on the contrary, prefer a book-search for their readers. Finding an optimal way to reconcile the preferences of distinct types of libraries is one of great challenges we are facing to solve in the Knihovny.cz.</p>

<p>To easily find what you are searching for, <strong>it is best to use the filters</strong> in the side bar of the search results. If you are looking for e.g. a book, please choose <strong>&quot;Books&quot;</strong> in the filter category <strong>&quot;type of a document&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>Portal Knihovny.cz is in the beginnings. Soon, answers on more questions you are interested in the most will be available here.</p>
