<h2>Lending services</h2>

<p>Lending of books and other documents in printed and electronic format is one of the basic services of the libraries that you can use. You may borrow directly in the premises of the libraries (borrowing in person), as well as outside the libraries (distance borrowing). The conditions for registration of readers, rules for use of the library services and duties of the users and libraries are found in the library rules.</p>

<p>The catalogues of a specific library are used for selection, searching and ordering of titles; these catalogues are mostly publicly available on the Internet. <strong>The Knihovny.cz portal concentrates a large number of catalogues from various libraries all over the Czech Republic into a single database and makes it possible for you to borrow and order the searched titles.</strong></p>

<p>The duration of the loan is stated against each document. If another reader is not interested in the title, then it is usually possible to extend the loan period before is lapses. In case of overrun of this load period, the library shall impose a fine. The size of the fine is given in the price list of the given library. If a document is lost or damaged, the library seeks a book replacement or financial compensation.</p>

<h2>Making copies of documents (reprographic services)</h2>

<p>You can make copies of documents for a fee from the library resources. This concerns, so-called, reprographic services. The Copyright Act applies to the books in the bookshop and the titles loaned in the libraries. The copies from the libraries are therefore intended only for your personal, educational and research needs or needs of the organisation itself.</p>

<p>Reprographic services are offered in many&nbsp;libraries:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Self-service copying in the library premises</li>
	<li>Printed copies to order</li>
	<li>Copies of documents from other libraries in the Czech Republic or abroad</li>
	<li>Printing (self-service or to order) from electronic information resources, the Internet, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some libraries in the Czech Republic offer other reprographic services, which include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Digital copies provided via electronic document delivery service</li>
	<li>Digital copies of copyright free works that are provided via the <a href="https://books2ebooks.eu/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">eBooks on Demand</a> service</li>
	<li>Digital copies of free works or works for which the applicant has obtained the consent of the holder of copyright</li>
	<li>Copies of microfilms, microfiche, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The price list and scope of services is given on the website of the specific library. The librarians shall also provide it to you in the libraries.</p>

<p>You can order copies of documents personally in the library, by correspondence or electronically, e.g. by e-mail or via a special form. The libraries provide some reprographic services only to registered users (e.g. copies of documents from other libraries) or on the basis of the contracts concluded in advance (e.g. electronic document delivery services).</p>

<h2>Professional consulting (reference services)</h2>

<p>The libraries serve all that need advice, consultation or information. The librarians are ready to answer queries that will help you in the use of the library, find the relevant resources or get factographical information.</p>

<p>You can submit queries to the library in various ways, from personal contact with the library to electronic means (e.g. e-mail or website form). Some libraries also offer consultation via chat. You can also communicate with the libraries and librarians via the <a href="http://www.ptejteseknihovny.cz/english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ask the library</a>&nbsp;service.&nbsp;You will receive an answer to your query within 2 business days.</p>

<h2>Assistance with searching (research services)</h2>

<p>Search of literature on a given topic is provided by the libraries via the so-called research service. The result is research &ndash; an overview of the basic information and documents, i.e. a list of the bibliographic quotations (includes the name of the author, title, publisher, year of publication, number of pages, ISBN/ISSN). Before ordering the research, we recommend that you consider your choice of library where you will make the order. The most suitable is the one that in terms of focus and resources best corresponds to the given topic.</p>

<p>The libraries in the processing of the research usually use their own catalogues, Czech and foreign databases, which they subscribe for users, printed bibliographies, freely accessible databases, digital libraries, etc. The conditions for processing of the research may differ in individual libraries. It is mostly a paid service. The specific offer of research services, processing conditions and price list are available on the website of the given library or will be provided to you by the librarian.</p>

<h2>What else do the libraries offer to you?</h2>

<p>Many libraries also provide services to visitors, such as day and night study rooms, daily newspaper reading rooms, self-service return of books outside opening hours (bibliobox), lending of board games, children&#39;s corners, specialised services for seniors and the disabled (home delivery of books, special resources, parking), bookbinding services (laminating, ring or fixed binding and related activities) or a listening room for music and watching video recordings from the library resources.</p>

<p>You will find the detailed overview of the offered services on the website of the given library or you can get the information directly from the librarian.
