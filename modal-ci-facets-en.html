<p>You can use filters <strong>to make search results more accurate</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first set of filters you can set these search parameters:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><span class="pcolor">“Find fulltext documents”</span></strong>: Restricts the search to only those documents that have full text available online.</li>
    <li><strong><span class="pcolor">“Find reviewed documents”</span></strong>: Restricts searches only to peer reviewed documents that have passed the review process.</li>
    <li><strong><span class="pcolor">“Search also fulltexts of documents”</span></strong>: Extends search - In addition to document information, their full texts are searched too (if available). Without this option, only metadata, (ie document information), is searched. Recommended when you didn't find enough documents in basic search.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you yse multiple filters of the same type (e.g. <em>"biology"</em> and <em>"statistics"</em> in <strong>"Subjects"</strong>) <strong>AND</strong> logical operator is applied.</p>

<p>When using filter <strong>&quot;Year of publication&quot;</strong> confirm your choice by <strong>&quot;Use filter&quot;</strong> button.</p>

<p>You can remove applied filters one by one (click the cross pictogram <img alt="cross" src="https://github.com/moravianlibrary/CPK/raw/master/themes/bootstrap3/images/hints/krizek.png" style="height:13px; width:13px" />) or all at once (use the button <strong>&quot;Remove filters&quot;</strong>).</p>

<p>If you are using any filter and you want to enter a new search query, you can choose the option to <strong>&quot;Search with current filters&quot;</strong> (checkbox <strong>under the search field</strong>). This option is set as default and can be unchecked.</p>
