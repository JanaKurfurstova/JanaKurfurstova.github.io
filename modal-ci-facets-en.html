<p>You can use filters <strong>to make search results more accurate</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first set of filters you can set these search parameters:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>“Search also fulltexts of documents”</strong>: Restricts the search to only those documents that have full text available online.</li>
    <li><strong>“Search also fulltexts of documents”</strong>: Restricts searches only to peer reviewed documents that have passed the review process.</li>
    <li><strong>“Search also fulltexts of documents”</strong>: Extends search - In addition to document information, their full texts are searched too (if available). Without this option, only metadata, (ie document information), is searched.</li>
</ul>
