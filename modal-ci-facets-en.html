<p>You can use filters <strong>to make search results more accurate</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first set of filters you can set these search parameters:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><span class="pcolor">“Find fulltext documents”</span></strong>: Restricts the search to only those documents that have full text available online.</li>
    <li><strong><span class="pcolor">“Find reviewed documents”</span></strong>: Restricts searches only to peer reviewed documents that have passed the review process.</li>
    <li><strong><span class="pcolor">“Search also fulltexts of documents”</span></strong>: Extends search - In addition to document information, their full texts are searched too (if available). Without this option, only metadata, (ie document information), is searched.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you yse multiple filters of the same type (e.g. <em>"biology"</em> and <em>"statistics"</em> in <strong>"Subjects"</strong>) <strong>AND</strong> logical operator is applied.</p>

<p>When using filter <strong>&quot;Year of publication&quot;</strong> confirm your choice by <strong>&quot;Use filter&quot;</strong> button.</p>

<p>You can remove applied filters one by one (click the cross pictogram <span class="pcolor"><i class="fa fa-times">&nbsp;</i></span>) or all at once (use the button <strong>&quot;Remove filters&quot;</strong>).</p>

<p>If you are using any filter and you want to enter a new search query, you can choose the option to <strong>&quot;Search with current filters&quot;</strong> (checkbox <strong>under the search field</strong>). This option is set as default and can be unchecked.</p>
