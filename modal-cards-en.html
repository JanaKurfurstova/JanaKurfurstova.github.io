<p><strong>Link your&nbsp;accounts from connected&nbsp;libraries and social networks.</strong></p>

<p>Click on&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Connect another account&quot;</strong> button and continue by logging in with an account of any institution&nbsp;listed in&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Connect with library account&quot;</strong> or social network account from&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Alternative login&quot;</strong> list (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub<!--, mojeID-->, ORCID).</p>

<p>Once you attach other connected library&#39;s account to your identity, you&nbsp;<strong>gain access an overview of your activities in this library, and you will be able to order or reserve publications.</strong></p>

<p>In case&nbsp;<strong>you are not registered in any of the connected libraries</strong>&nbsp;and logged in just&nbsp;<strong>using&nbsp;a social network account or <!--mojeID or -->ORCID</strong>, you will not be able to order or reserve a publication in connected libraries, though&nbsp;<strong>you can still save your favorite searches and records</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Learn more about registration in participating libraries&nbsp;<a href="../../../Portal/Page/moznosti-prihlaseni-a-registrace" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>You can use any of your connected accounts to access your idenity. You can simply&nbsp;<strong>disconnect</strong> your linked accounts anytime. It is also possible to&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Delete identity&quot;&nbsp;</strong>- this action removes all your user settings, saved searches and favorites lists</p>

<p><strong>Linking more than one account within one library is not possible. It is also not possible to link one account from library A with more than one account from library</strong><strong>&nbsp;B</strong> (as library cards are not transferable).</p>

<h6>(*)The identity in Knihovny.cz ties your linked library and social network accounts. When you sing in for the first time, your portal identity includes just one account - that one you used for your first logging in. The decision to connect more accounts is up to you.</h6>
