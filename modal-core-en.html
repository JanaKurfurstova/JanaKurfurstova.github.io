<p>The rules of borrowing publications in different libraries can vary widely.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>It is usually necessary to be a registered member of the library to borrow a publication.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The <span style="color:#e5004b">&quot;I want to borrow&quot;</span> button is visible only for users registered in current record&#39;s library.</strong></p>

<p>These are common borrowing options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The item is <strong>available</strong> and you can see <strong>&quot;I want to borrow&quot;</strong> button. You can <strong>order</strong> the book.</li>
	<li>The item is <strong>available</strong> and you cannot see <strong>&quot;I want to borrow&quot;</strong> button. It is necessary to <strong>visit the library in person to borrow</strong> the publication.</li>
	<li>The item <strong>is borrowed</strong> and you can see <strong>&quot;I want to borrow&quot;</strong> button. You can <strong>reserve</strong> the book.</li>
	<li>The item is <strong>not available</strong> or <strong>it is not possible to see its avalability</strong> remotely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some libraries could offer different user categories and different borrowing options.</p>

<p><em>This is just a generic help which appears when there is no library-specific help.</em></p>
